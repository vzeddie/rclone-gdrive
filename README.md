This repo is from the archives written a while ago

The need was that I had a Raspberry Pi 3 and I wanted to use CherryTree on it (VPN + VNC = remote journal!). I wanted to keep my CherryTree file in sync in Google Drive. Alas, there is no official Linux GDrive daemon so I wrote my own using `rclone` which is a valid way of sync-ing to and from cloud services
